"Catur Hendra"

"I was born in 2002 in Surabaya, a lively city full of culture and diversity. As the youngest of four siblings, I always had a curious and adventurous spirit. My passion for IT sparked when I attended a vocational school, where I discovered the wonders of web development. I wanted to pursue this path as a profession, so I enrolled in the computer science program at State University of Surabaya. There, I continued to learn and grow as a web developer, eager to explore new challenges and opportunities.""# catur.github.io"
